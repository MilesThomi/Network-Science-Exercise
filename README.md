# Network-Science-Exercise
This repository contains a conceptual network similar to a mindmap of my (Tobias Thomi) visited lectures at the University of Bern. Each lecture has been categorized under one or more of the following core topics:
    Hydrology,
    Natural Hazards,
    Spatial Planning,
    Methods,
    and Management.
The structure is designed to provide a interconnected overview of the subjects covered.
